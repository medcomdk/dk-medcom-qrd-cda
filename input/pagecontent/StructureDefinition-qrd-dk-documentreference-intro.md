# Scope and Usage

The profile is called QRDDKDocumentReference, and inherits contraints from [CoreDocumentReference](https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-xds-metadata-core/StructureDefinition-core-documentreference.html). QRDDKDocumentReference is further profiled to include ValueSets relevant for QRD-DK.

The element DocumentReference.masterIdentifier include a system stating that the value is a UUID, and a value from the CDA-document (ClinicalDocument.id) which uniquely identifies the type of document and version.
